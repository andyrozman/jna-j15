Java Native Access for Java 1.5 (JNA-J15)
==========================================

If you want to know more about JNA itself please look at README.md instead. 


This fork was created because I am implementing and mantaing application that still runs on Java 1.5. Since I needed library for working with HID devices, I found one 
which has JNA as dependency, so I created this fork. Initial version (4.1.0) contained only files need to create correct artifact, but with 4.2.2 I made full import
from original's project 4.2.2 branch, which in turn required me to totally rework supplied pom files (they were just stubs, that didn't create artifacts).



HISTORY AND RELEASES
====================

4.2.2 - next version, whole copy of origins 4.2.2 branch
4.1.0 - initial version (not whole fork), release 4.1.0 and it has its own branch called 4.1.0


FUTURE
======

Perhaps 5.x versions, but for now it's not in plan.
